The solution depends on the root cause. One common cause could be a dependency conflict, or issues with native modules. If these are not resolved during the first attempts, the solution might involve a complete clean of the build cache. You can do this with the command: `expo prebuild --clean` and then retry the `expo prebuild` command.  If the problem persists, check your `package.json` for any conflicting or incorrect dependencies, and rebuild the project.  Debugging this issue usually involves close examination of the full build log, searching for more specific error messages embedded within the broader failure report.
